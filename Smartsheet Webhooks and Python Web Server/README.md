# Web server and Smartsheet webhook demo

These scripts demonstrate how to:
- Work with Smartsheet webhooks (push notifications that something has changed in a Smartsheet doc)
- Create a web server that can process GET/PUT requests
- Read and update data from Smartsheet
- Send an HTML-formatted e-mail

See the comments in the script for more details.
