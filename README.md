# Kirk's Sample Code Repository

This repository contains mostly Python scripts, many of which are related to Snowflake, that demonstrate a variety of solutions I've created over the last few years for various clients.

Some of the code is quite simple but combines techniques to meet specific needs that I couldnâ€™t find solutions for anywhere else.  Additionally, some of the code samples are only small subsets of larger projects to avoid embedding proprietary business logic.

Enjoy!
