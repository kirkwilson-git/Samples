# Demo for replicating a SQL Server database to Snowflake

Shows how to copy SQL Server data structures (tables/views) and their data to Snowflake.  Depending on network performance and the size of the source data, this can take a significant amount of time but for small-to-medium sized data sets, this script performs generally quickly.

See the comments in the script for more details.
