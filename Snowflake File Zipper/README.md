# File zipper demo

This was written specifically to zip up a collection of files for a SaaS application used by a client.  The specific logic within the script is irrelevant, but it does show a simple way to zip a collection of files.

Also contains sample code that demonstrates how to add all files within a folder into a single zip file.  Contains some minor logic specific to the client that can be ignored.

See the comments in the script for more details.
