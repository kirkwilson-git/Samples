# Kirk's Sample Code Repository

This repository contains mostly Python scripts, many of which are related to Snowflake, that demonstrate a variety of solutions I've created over the last few years for various clients.

Some of the code is quite simple but combines techniques to meet specific needs that I couldnâ€™t find solutions for anywhere else.  Additionally, some of the code samples are only small subsets of larger projects to avoid embedding proprietary business logic.

Finally, I've included some of my personal documentation examples that contain various bits of goodness that you should check out if you're at all interested in BI and/or Snowflake.

Enjoy!
